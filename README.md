Tutorial for Quantum Fourier Transfer

Welcome to our website dedicated to two of the most important concepts in quantum computing: the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Shor's algorithm for factoring large integers.

The QFT is a powerful tool that enables us to efficiently transform between the time domain and frequency domain of quantum states, and is a key component of many quantum algorithms beyond period finding, including quantum phase estimation and solving linear systems of equations.

Shor's algorithm is one of the most famous quantum algorithms, and has important implications for cryptography. It allows us to factor large integers exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm, and thus has the potential to break many classical cryptography systems. Our website includes a detailed explanation of Shor's algorithm, as well as step-by-step guides for its implementation using the Qiskit framework.

We hope our website will serve as a valuable resource for those interested in learning more about quantum computing, and welcome any feedback or questions you may have.
